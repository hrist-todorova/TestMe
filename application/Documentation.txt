TestMe - Creation of Exams

This application offers two functions:
- interactive creating of files with questions
- creating an exam from a file with questions

This repository contains two folders - one for source code files and one for test files.

The folder for source code is called src. It contains the .h and .cpp files for each class.
Currently the classes the application is using are
* Answer
* Exam
* File
* PrintableObject
* Question
* StringInterpreter
* Tag
* Test
* UserInterface

The testing code is in folder tests. For now there are only tests for class StringInterpreter.
